# Flutter Amplify Quickstart

This repo demonstrates how to get up and running with Flutter for cross-platform development, and AWS Amplify for rapid backend infrastructure provisioning.

## Prerequisites

* Flutter and dependent tools (XCode, Android Studio etc.)
* An AWS Account and AWS Amplify CLI installed

## Demoed Features

* MFA Authentication with pre-canned UI and AWS Cognito authz
* Profile Picture storage and upload functionality using AWS S3

## Getting Started

Check out this repository

Run an `amplify init` to setup your local environment

Follow this up with an `amplify push` to provision the Auth, Storage and API features in your AWS Account

Open the project in your Flutter IDE of choice (VSCode for me)

Pick your mobile simulator of choice, then hit F5 to run the application.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
